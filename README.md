# ESCP-BMS1
The software to communicate the ESCP-BMS1 pressure sensor with the SPI capable version of the ESEK-5C evaluation kit using SPI communication protocol is the same as the one needed for I2C communication. Please refer to [this branch](https://github.com/esenssys/ESCP-BMS1/tree/ESEK-5C-I2C) to download it and view the relevant documentation.

Please note that any section and parameter refering to I2C Slave/Device address is considered irrelevant for SPI communication and only exists in the software for communication protocol/driver compatibility with the I2C version.
